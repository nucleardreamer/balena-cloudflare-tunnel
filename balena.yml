  # Balena cloudflare tunnel example

  At balena, we have the concept of a [public URL](https://www.balena.io/docs/learn/develop/runtime/#public-device-urls), which routes your device's web ports over our VPN, and gives it a URL to access them.

  This is extremely useful for development, but not fit for running mission critical applications, as we don't have an SLA or guarentee of uptime on the public device URL feature.

  By using cloudflare tunnel, you are getting a near 1-1 equivilent of the public URL feature, but with _many_ more options. You would want to look at using this service for rolling out business critical access to your devices in the field.

  ## Setup

  You will need to set the `TUNNEL_TOKEN` environment variable for your device, which you get from 'Connect your app' in your Cloudflare tunnel. You can find instructions on setting it up [here](https://developers.cloudflare.com/cloudflare-one/connections/connect-apps/install-and-setup/tunnel-guide/remote/)

  Here is an example of the setup to use in your `docker-compose.yml`:

  ```
  version: '2'
  services:
    
    tunnel:
      image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
      network_mode: host
      restart: always
      command: tunnel run
      privileged: true
      cap_add:
        - SYS_ADMIN
        - NET_ADMIN
      labels:
        io.balena.features.dbus: '1'
      environment:
        DBUS_SYSTEM_BUS_ADDRESS: "unix:path=/host/run/dbus/system_bus_socket"
        # the TUNNEL_TOKEN variable is given to you in the cloudflare tunnel setup. It will be picked up automatically by this container, and you will need to set it in the balena dashboard. You can keep your token in the docker-compose file, but know that it will not be hidden by anyone that has access to view your releases
        # TUNNEL_TOKEN: XXXXXXXX
  ```
